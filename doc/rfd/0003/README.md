# RFD 3 deprecate bazel

## Context

The contributors of the KubeCF project think that Bazel's learning curve is too high for what it delivers to KubeCF.

## Decision

Deprecate Bazel in favor of a system that provides us with the same needed capabilites in KubeCF, but doesn't have the learning curve problem.

## Consequences

A spike has been scheduled to find alternatives: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/issues/749
